    <br>
    <b>Process</b>
    <ol>
        <li>
            For the first marinade, mix the lime juice, chilli powder and 1 tsp salt flakes in a large bowl. Add chicken pieces, then cover and transfer to the fridge to marinate for 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            For the second marinade, put all the ingredients into a mini food processor. Blend until smooth, then add to the marinated chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and transfer to the fridge for 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat your grill to its hottest setting. Thread the chicken on to lightly oiled metal skewers and grill until lightly charred in places but not completely cooked through, as youâ€™ll finish cooking them in the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            For the sauce, heat the ghee in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger and fry for a minute, then stir in the passata and bring to a simmer for 5 minutes. Add all the spices, the coconut, 11/2 tsp salt flakes and 100ml water and simmer for a further 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a mini food processor, blend the cashew nuts, pumpkin seeds and boiling water to a paste. Stir this into the sauce, followed by the chicken and another 100ml water.

        </li>
        <li>
            Simmer for 10 minutes, or until chicken is completely cooked through, then stir in the fenugreek, sugar and cream and cook for a further 2 minutes. Sprinkle with chat masala and garnish with fresh coriander and ginger, then serve.
